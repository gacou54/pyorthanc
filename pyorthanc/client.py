            Orthanc identifier of the patient of interest
        json
            Dictionary with the following keys:
            "Asynchronous": If `true`, run the job in asynchronous mode, which means that the REST API call will immediately return, reporting the identifier of a job. Prefer this flavor wherever possible.
            "DicomVersion": Version of the DICOM standard to be used for anonymization. Check out configuration option `DeidentifyLogsDicomVersion` for possible values.
            "Force": Allow the modification of tags related to DICOM identifiers, at the risk of breaking the DICOM model of the real world
            "Keep": List of DICOM tags whose value must not be destroyed by the anonymization. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "KeepPrivateTags": Keep the private tags from the DICOM instances (defaults to `false`)
            "KeepSource": If set to `false`, instructs Orthanc to the remove original resources. By default, the original resources are kept in Orthanc.
            "Permissive": If `true`, ignore errors during the individual steps of the job.
            "Priority": In asynchronous mode, the priority of the job. The lower the value, the higher the priority.
            "PrivateCreator": The private creator to be used for private tags in `Replace`
            "Remove": List of additional tags to be removed from the DICOM instances. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "Replace": Associative array to change the value of some DICOM tags in the DICOM instances. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "Synchronous": If `true`, run the job in synchronous mode, which means that the HTTP answer will directly contain the result of the job. This is the default, easy behavior, but it is *not* desirable for long jobs, as it might lead to network timeouts.
            "Transcode": Transcode the DICOM instances to the provided DICOM transfer syntax: https://book.orthanc-server.com/faq/transcoding.html

This argument is a semi-column separated list of DICOM Tags identifiers; e.g: 'requestedTags=0010,0010;PatientBirthDate'.  The tags requested tags are returned in the 'RequestedTags' field in the response.  Note that, if you are requesting tags that are not listed in the Main Dicom Tags stored in DB, building the response might be slow since Orthanc will need to access the DICOM files.

            "Asynchronous": If `true`, run the job in asynchronous mode, which means that the REST API call will immediately return, reporting the identifier of a job. Prefer this flavor wherever possible.
            "DicomVersion": Version of the DICOM standard to be used for anonymization. Check out configuration option `DeidentifyLogsDicomVersion` for possible values.
            "Force": Allow the modification of tags related to DICOM identifiers, at the risk of breaking the DICOM model of the real world
            "Keep": List of DICOM tags whose value must not be destroyed by the anonymization. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "KeepPrivateTags": Keep the private tags from the DICOM instances (defaults to `false`)
            "KeepSource": If set to `false`, instructs Orthanc to the remove original resources. By default, the original resources are kept in Orthanc.
            "Permissive": If `true`, ignore errors during the individual steps of the job.
            "Priority": In asynchronous mode, the priority of the job. The lower the value, the higher the priority.
            "PrivateCreator": The private creator to be used for private tags in `Replace`
            "Remove": List of additional tags to be removed from the DICOM instances. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "Replace": Associative array to change the value of some DICOM tags in the DICOM instances. Starting with Orthanc 1.9.4, paths to subsequences can be provided using the same syntax as the `dcmodify` command-line tool (wildcards are supported as well).
            "Synchronous": If `true`, run the job in synchronous mode, which means that the HTTP answer will directly contain the result of the job. This is the default, easy behavior, but it is *not* desirable for long jobs, as it might lead to network timeouts.
            "Transcode": Transcode the DICOM instances to the provided DICOM transfer syntax: https://book.orthanc-server.com/faq/transcoding.html

        """Create ZIP archive

        Synchronously create a ZIP archive containing the DICOM study whose Orthanc identifier is provided in the URL. This flavor is synchronous, which might *not* be desirable to archive large amount of data, as it might lead to network timeouts. Prefer the asynchronous version using `POST` method.

            Dictionary with the following keys:
            "Asynchronous": If `true`, create the archive in asynchronous mode, which means that a job is submitted to create the archive in background.
            "Priority": In asynchronous mode, the priority of the job. The lower the value, the higher the priority.
            "Synchronous": If `true`, create the archive in synchronous mode, which means that the HTTP answer will directly contain the ZIP file. This is the default, easy behavior. However, if global configuration option "SynchronousZipStream" is set to "false", asynchronous transfers should be preferred for large amount of data, as the creation of the temporary file might lead to network timeouts.

            "Force": Avoid the consistency checks for the DICOM tags that enforce the DICOM model of the real-world. You can notably use this flag if you need to manually set the tags `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, or `SOPInstanceUID`. Be careful with this feature.
            "InterpretBinaryTags": If some value in the `Tags` associative array is formatted according to some [data URI scheme encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme), whether this value is decoded to a binary value or kept as such (`true` by default)
